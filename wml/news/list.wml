<h2>Mailing List</h2>

<p>
There is an official support mailing list for WML users: 
</p>

<div class="box">
<b>wml-users</b> <b>@</b> <b>thewml.org</b>
</div>

<p>
Here you can reach the WML maintainer Denis Barbier and the
other people who use WML and which can help you in case of
problems. Use this forum to spread your ideas and suggestion,
too. Feel free to ask anything WML-related you want.
This mailing-list is international and all messages must be
posted in English.
</p>

<h2>Hypertext Archive</h2>

<p>
The mailing list is automatically archived and a HTML representation is
generated once a day for Web access.

</p>

<div class="indent">
<p>
<tt>subscribe wml-users</tt> <i>you@domain.dom</i>
</p>
</div>

<p>
in the <i>body</i> (leave the subject empty). After sending this, Majordomo
will respond with an authority challenge which has to send back again for

<p>
Please notice that this list allows only subscribers to post because of the
existing spamming services. So make sure you're already subscribed before
posting and that your E-mail address when posting is the same as used when you
subscribed. If it's not possible for you to use exactly this address please
mail <a href="mailto:rse@engelschall.com">Ralf S. Engelschall</a> the
additional addresses you want to allow posting.
