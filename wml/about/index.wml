<h2>Abstract</h2>

<b>WML - Website META Language</b>

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>
WML is a free HTML generation toolkit for Unix, internally consisting of 9
independent languages. The main idea of WML is a sequential filtering scheme
where each language provides one of 9 processing passes. So WML reads an input
file, applies passes 1-9 (or optionally only the passes specified) and finally
produces one or more output files. 
</p>
<p>
For maximum power WML ships with an already written set of include files
which define additional higher-level functionality. The same way you can write
your own custom HTML tagsets for WML to extend its functionality for your
particular needs.  So, whatever HTML tag you want (and WML not already
provides), you just can program it yourself in Perl. WML is not a closed
toolbox, its only the core upon which you can base your HTML generation
environment.
</p>

<h2>Intent</h2>

<p>
It operates as a powerful offline HTML generation toolkit for webmasters.
While not trivial and idiot proof it provides most of the features real
hackers always wanted for HTML generation.
</p>

<h2>Highlight</h2>

<p>
The trick of WML are its 9 languages which are evaluated in sequence.  
These are:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Pass 1: Source Reading and Include File Expansion (<tt>ipp</tt>)</li>
<li>Pass 2: HTML Macro Construct Expansion (<tt>mp4h</tt>)</li>
<li>Pass 3: Perl 5 Programming Construct Expansion (<tt>eperl</tt>)</li>
<li>Pass 4: M4 Macro Construct Expansion (<tt>gm4</tt>)</li>
<li>Pass 5: Diversion Filter (<tt>divert</tt>)</li>
<li>Pass 6: Character and String Substitution (<tt>asubst</tt>)</li>
<li>Pass 7: HTML Fixup (<tt>htmlfix</tt>)</li>
<li>Pass 8: Line Stripping and Output Fixup (<tt>htmlstrip</tt>)</li>
<li>Pass 9: Output Splitting and Final Writing (<tt>slice</tt>)</li>
</ul>

<p>
...you are just a WWW user.<br />
...you only created a few web pages in your lifetime.<br />
...your primary HTML creation platform is Windows or Macintosh.<br />

<h2>About the Logo</h2>

<p>
The logo symbolically shows the toothed wheels of WML's passes through which
the markup code runs. Another important thing is the big "META" because WML
just is a wrapper around existing languages.
